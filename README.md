# Network modeling UDD 2024

## Introduction

If you are reading this, it is because you know that networks are
everywhere. Network science is a rapidly growing field that has been
applied to many different disciplines, from biology to sociology, from
computer science to physics. In this course, we will go over advanced
network science topics; particularly, statistical inference in networks.
The course contents are:

- Overview of statistical inference.

- Introduction to network science inference.

- Motif detection.

- Global statistics (e.g., modularity).

- Random graphs (static).

- Random graphs (dynamic).

- Co-evolution of networks and behavior.

- Advanced topics (sampling and conditional models).
