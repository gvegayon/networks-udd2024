While there are many ways of studying the coevolution or dependence between network and behavior, in this section we focus on two classes of analysis: When the network is fixed, and when both network and behavior influence each other.\nWhether we treat the network as given or endogenous sets the complexity of conducting statistical inference. If the focus of our research is on individual-level outcomes embedded in a network and not on the network itself, data analysis becomes much simpler. Here, we will deal with three particular cases: (1) when network effects are lagged, (2) egocentric networks, and (3) when network effects are contemporaneous."
